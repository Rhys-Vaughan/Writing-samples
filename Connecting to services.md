# Connecting to services

To automate with most apps in Make, you must first create a connection. Through this connection, Make communicates with the third-party service according to the settings of your specific scenario.

For example, if you want to create a scenario in which you intend to work with your [Facebook](https://www.make.com/en/integrations/facebook) posts, you must first grant Make access permission to your Facebook account.

## Create a connection

1.  Go to your Make scenario and choose the module you want to use. If a given module requires a connection to a service, **Connection** is the first option.

2.  Click **Add**.

3.  A default connection name appears. You can change it if you want.
    
4.  Click **Save**.

    **Note**
    For some connections, you may also wish to check the **Show advanced settings** option and fill in additional fields.
    
5.  When creating a connection to most third-party services, Make redirects you to their web page which prompts you to grant Make access to your data.
    
6.  When prompted, authorize Make.
    
You have now successfully established the connection.

## Access rights

For every connection, Make requires only those access rights necessary to successfully complete a specific scenario. For example, if you create a scenario that downloads posts from Facebook, Make will not ask for permission to post them.

Unfortunately, not all services allow you to limit access to only specific tasks. Therefore, Make requires full access rights. For more information on how to restrict Make access to your account registered to those services, see the [application-specific documentation](https://www.make.com/en/help/apps).

Personal data security is Make's top priority. For detailed information on how your data is secured and protected in Make, [click here](https://www.make.com/en/privacy-notice).

## Managing connections

You can manage your connections in the **Connections** section. Here you can see which permissions Make has for each connection and rename, reauthorize, or delete existing connections. Click **Verify** to check if a connection to a service is established.

## Renewing a connection

Make usually obtains access rights to a given service for an unlimited period of time. However, this is not always the case. With some services, you must renew the access permission after a certain period of time. To renew a connection, click **Reauthorize** in the **Connections** section.

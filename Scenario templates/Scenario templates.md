# Scenario templates

### What is a template?

Templates are predefined [scenarios](https://www.make.com/en/help/scenarios/scenario-editor) that you can expand and customize to create new scenarios. You can then [share](https://www.make.com/en/help/scenarios/scenario-templates#sharing-templates) these with friends and colleagues.

### Benefits of templates

-   Creating your scenarios becomes much easier. Instead of starting each new scenario from scratch, you can use a template as a foundation to expand upon.
    
-   Share your templates with anyone.
    
-   Save your templates for future use.
    

### Who can create templates?

Anyone with a **Teams** plan or higher can create templates. See the available [subscription plans](http://www.make.com/en/pricing).

## Using templates

You can find the **Templates** tab under your **Team** in the left-hand menu.

Search for templates using the search bar in the top-right corner.

### Template types

#### Team templates

Team templates are those you and your team create. From the team templates screen you can create, customize, save, and share your templates with others.

**Notice**:
Team templates can be _private_ or _published_.
-   _Private_
    Visible only to the team. Cannot be shared.
-   _Published_
    Visible to anyone with the shareable link.
    

#### Public templates

A collection of templates created by Make and our partners that demonstrate many common integrations. Anyone can use them to create their own scenarios.

You can [send your _published_ templates for approval](https://www.make.com/en/help/scenarios/scenario-templates#sharing-templates) to make them available in the public templates library.

**Notice**:
You cannot edit a _published_ template, but you can still access and edit the _private_ version.
If you re-edit and wish to publish again, follow the steps above. The new _published_ template overwrites the previous one.

### Share a public link

Once you publish your template you can share it with others.

- Click **Share public link** in the top-right corner to copy the link to your clipboard.

**Note**:
Template recipients cannot change or clone the template.

### Requesting approval

You can send your _published_ templates for approval to make them available in the public templates library.

-   Click **Request approval** in the top-right corner.

The button now reads “Approval pending”.

A Make administrator reviews your template for public use. After approval, Make adds your template to the public templates library.

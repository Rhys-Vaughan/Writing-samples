# Scheduling a scenario

Make allows you to define when and how often an [activated](https://www.make.com/en/help/scenarios/active-and-inactive-scenarios) scenario executes.

1.  Go to the [scenario detail page](https://www.make.com/en/help/scenarios/scenario-detail)
    
2.  Open the **Schedule setting panel** under the **Options** tab
    
3.  Click **Scheduling**
    

### Schedule setting panel

The schedule setting panel lets you adjust the running schedule of the scenario. By default, a scenario runs every 15 minutes, but within this panel, you can customize the run schedule and the interval.

### Run scenario

You can select the following schedule options:

-   Immediately
    
-   At regular intervals
    
-   Once
    
-   Every day
    
-   Days of the week
    
-   Days of the month
    
-   Specified dates
    

When choosing any of these options, you may have to further define how often you want the run to occur. For example, if you select the _At regular intervals_ option you must define the time interval (in minutes) between two consecutive scenario runs.

The minimal length of the interval depends on your [subscription plan](https://www.make.com/en/pricing).

The _Immediately_ option is available only for some triggers. For more information on triggers, please see the [types of modules](https://www.make.com/en/help/modules/types-of-modules) help guide.

### Start and end date

To define the time range in which an activated scenario runs, check the **Show advanced settings** box and fill in the _Start_ and _End_ date.
